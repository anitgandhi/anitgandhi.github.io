				<p>For many years prior to college, I was set on working in IT for the rest of my life. As I started doing a part-time campus IT job, I realized I wanted something more. From freshman year forward, I wasn't quite sure what I was interested in, besides knowing that I wanted to do "something with software." But, let's face it, who doesn't want to do that right now?</p>
				
				<p>Then I took the Cryptology 1 course during my semester in Denmark, and that's when things started coming together. With all the security and privacy revelations of the past couple years, and my (limited) IT experience, I realized computer/network security could be the right field for me. Going forward, I hope to learn more about applied cryptography (especially elliptic-curve based systems) and new authentication techniques.</p>

				<h2>Why Security?</h2>

				<p>I only really recently became interested in cyber security. Previously I was always on the other side of it: I was fixing people's computers that had malware on it. As I became more curious about computers in general, I always had a particular cuiousity towards how malware is made and how it exploits computers. It's when I took the Cryptology 1 course in Denmark that my interest became a little more solidified, and it really took hold after completing Computer Security Lab at UIUC.</p>

				<p>In general, security is a fun, and for better or for worse, a very relevant field to be in right now. Of course, security is one of those fields that is perpetually relevant, but given everything that has occurred since July 2013, cyber security is particularly important today.</p>

				<p>I particularly enjoy the cryptography field within cyber security. Of course, I'm no mathematician and as such, cannot call myself a cryptographer. I would, however, call myself a software developer, so applied cryptography like SSL/TLS is what really interests me going forward.</p>

				<p>Down the line, I hope to somehow get involved with educating both end users and developers alike about security and why its important, and its role relative to their privacy. I personally believe that all software developrs have a responsibility to their customers to design their code with security in mind from the start, and that we should all strive to provide the best level of security we can to our users.</p>

				<h2>Courses</h2>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<h3>CS 225</h3>
					<h4>C++, Data Structures</h4>
					<p>This entire class was focused on learning data structures Object Oriented Programming in C++. We learned about all sorts of trees, hash tables, graphs and more - and looked at their features like insertion and access runtimes, dimension limits, etc.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<h3>ECE 391</h3>
					<h4>Computer Systems Engineering</h4>
					<p>The main chunk of this class was creating a basic operating system in a team. We created a simple kernel that boots up the system with a small set of drivers, and hooked up interrupt handlers for those devices, like the keyboard and display.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<h3>CS 460</h3>
					<h4>Computer Security Lab</h4>
					<p>While there are multiple computer security classes at UIUC, this one is particularly fun because it's very hands-on. Most of the learning happens in learning about vulnerabilities and exploits and applying them in labs. Of course, we still had to learn about the underlying concepts like buffer overflows and the OSI model to understand why these exploits occur, but the labs were the focus.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<h3>Cryptology 1</h3>
					<p>As I mentioned, I took this class abroad. We focused on learning about four main things and how they all work: block ciphers like AES and DES, public key cryptosystems like RSA and ElGamal, digital signature systems like RSA and DSA, and cryptographic hash functions like MD5 and the SHA family. Unfortunatley, since it was considered an introductory class, we did not go into elliptic curve based systems. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">
					<h3>Data Compression</h3>
					<p>This was the other main class I took abroad. we learned about how various compression algorithms work. In general, all compression follows a few similar steps like quantization and differential or arithmetic encoding. With that basic outline in mind, we delved deeper into popular algoritms like JPEG, and learned how it uses the discrete cosine transform (DCT) for quantization and encoding.</p>

					<p>For my Data Compression final project in Denmark, I applied the Lempel-Ziv-Welch universal lossless compression algorithm to bitmap (BMP) images, text, and general binary files in C++. I then analyzed the results' compression ratios, runtime memory usage, and image quality.</p>
					<p>This was done as a learning experience more than anything else. As such, it shouldn't be considered as anything viable.</p>

					<h3><a href="https://github.com/anitgandhi/rust-ssl" target="_blank">Rust SSL</a></h3>
					<p>For CS 460, UIUC's Computer Security Lab course, I and three others attempted creating a very barebones version of SSL cryptographic algorithms in the (relatively) new programming language Rust.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately we only got around to creating AES256, HMAC-SHA256, and Diffie-Hellman. Rust itself stabilized to version 1.0 at the end of our project, and it was a very new and very different language to all of us. It was a great learning experience for all of us though.</p>

					<p>This was one of the first side projects I really did, and it was certainly my first exposure to the wacky world of JavaScript and JSON. This Chrome Extension was a way to view how many lab computers were available eat each UIUC Engineering Work Stations lab, based on readily available JSON data from EWS.</p>
